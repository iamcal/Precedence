that are useful to a hunter who wants to maximize their DPS.

Shot priorities:

* Leave 2s between Explosive Shot casts during Lock & Load

Warnings:
* Missing or unhappy pet
* Incorrect aspects
* Missing hunter's mark
* Wrong weapon equipped
* Growl unexpectedly on/off
* Kirin Tor (teleport) ring equipped

Timers:
* Misdirect applied, active & on cooldown (with target)
* Hunter's mark active
* Serpent sting active
* Mend pet active
* Freeze traps set & triggered (with target)
