Precedence is a raiding hunter's dashboard. It shows shot priority countdowns, warnings and timers
that are useful to a hunter who wants to maximize their DPS.

Shot priorities:
* Configurable priorities
* Key bindings
* Use macros to trigger shots
* Time shots to buffs and debuffs
* Long cooldowns displayed in a useful way

Warnings:
* Missing or unhappy pet
* Incorrect aspects
* Missing hunter's mark
* Wrong weapon equipped
* Growl unexpectedly on/off
* Kirin Tor (teleport) ring equipped

Timers:
* Misdirect applied, active & on cooldown (with target)
* Hunter's mark active
* Serpent sting active
* Mend pet active
* Freeze traps set & triggered (with target)



TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* config for priorities

* Time between explosive shots on LnL (use fixed time rather than waiting for debuff)
* No readiness during rapid fire - make configable
* confiurable percentages for aspect switching
* Extra wait times for high priority shots
* Rules for serpent sting (don't use near end)
* Different shots for raid bosses & dungeon bosses
* Pet attacking?
* Not enough mana for certain shots
* deactivate when dead!
* warn when wearing pvp gear
